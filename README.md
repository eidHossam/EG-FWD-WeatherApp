# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
I used ES6 when writing the code.
I made the HTML and CSS files from scratch to get used to working wiht html and css and put my own style in the project.
I wrote comments to make the code more readable.

## Instructions

You need to write the zip code of the city you want to search for (US).
Adding the feelings part is optional.
The app will show you:
1- City name
2- Date of the search
3- Temp
4- Your feelings if you entered one.
